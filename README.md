# Guitar Story

Learning the guitar can be challenging for beginners, particularly when it comes to memorizing scale positions, finger placements, and fretboard navigation.  
Traditional methods, such as attending regular guitar lessons, can be expensive and inconvenient, making self-learning a more attractive option.

Guitar Story is a gamified web application designed to make guitar learning more engaging and accessible. It leverages computer vision and real-time feedback to guide learners in mastering the fretboard.
